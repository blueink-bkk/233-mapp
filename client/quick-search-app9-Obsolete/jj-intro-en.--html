  Glossary of terms and words, often disappeared in everyday language, and even sometime unknown of dictionaries, used in the old catalogs of heating and cooking appliances and their components. These words in French can be used in the Ultimheat Museum website's search engine. The examples are for most of them extracted from the Museum Ultimheat catalogs; some of them are drawn from the transcribed documents of
  <font color="#0033CC"><u>
    "Chronological list that can be used for the history of heating”. </u></font>
    The references to dictionaries are sometimes taken from the public domain documents. References to patents and related pictures are from the INPI database. All the pictures extracted from catalogues are from the Ultimheat Museum original documents.

  Search is done by entering at least the first 3 characters of the word and selecting among the proposals that appear.
